Name-value pair SDK for ColdFusion

System Requirements
ColdFusion 9 and above
Railo 3.2 and above

This is a rewrite of the name-value pair SDK. Components are written in full cfscript which is only supported by newer CFML engines. If you're using an older version of one of the CFML engines, please use the previous version of the name value pair SDK.

Setup
1. Copy the "lib" directory into your project.
2. Create a customtag path to the "lib" and "lib/services" directory. You can do this in the ColdFusion Administrator or in the Application.cfc file. To see an example, look at the application.cfc file in the samples directory.
